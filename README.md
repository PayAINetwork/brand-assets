# Pay AI Brand Assets

Official Pay AI brand assets for press, partners, and community use.

## Structure
- `assets/mark/` — Standalone mark at sizes `16`, `50`, `250`, `500` with `png/` and `svg/`.
- `assets/wordmark/` — Wordmark variants in `png/` and `svg/`.
- `assets/lockups/` — Combined mark + wordmark organized by orientation:
  - `horizontal/` and `vertical/`, each with `png/` and `svg/`.

## File formats
- Prefer SVG for web and print when supported; use PNG otherwise.
